Murder 4 she wrote on a recycled hotel bible.
She was another self destructive messy little girl.
Her heart got stuck on someone else’s bad luck.
He was a lying lawyer with a sleeve full of mystery.
He shared his love with a fist full of green pills. 
The more she swallowed, the more she wallowed.
She was strong, yet naive, and he made her believe.
Everything kept going so wrong and it wasn't the way she planned.
One more perc, one more line, one more sip.
That was it, she was an addict.

He used her body and drained it dry.
He bruised her arms but she just wanted to fly.
Or die. Whichever would come faster.
Then he left her alone in this new world. 
She found every drug she wanted through networking, 
because being sober wasn't working.
Her fragile little body He was the center of attention,
but she failed to mention the help that she needed.
Everyone was pleading e but she wasn't ready to stop.
Her mouth whispered denial but her green eyes were screaming out.
She was consumed in fear and doubt.
She wanted to be left alone but cried when everyone was gone.
A line straight to the brain so she could forget the pain.
An addicts an addict, it’s always the same.
